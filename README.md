```

git clone https://github.com/gerald-apm/hacktoberfest-intro.git
```

There you have it! You just created a local copy of forked repository on you computer. Good job!

### Create Branch In Local Computer

It is common practice to have a new branch for each new feature or bug-fixes that you are working on. Let's go ahead and create one.

If you have not created the branch yet, start by changing your directory to the directory that was created when you run git clone:

```sh
cd hacktoberfest-intro
```

Create new branch for working by running this command.

```sh
git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>
```

> Note: Replace `your-new-branch-name` with something that you are about to work on, i.e.

```sh
git checkout -b create-profile
```

### Add your first file

Add your first file with the name `profile-[username].md` on the `contributors/` directory in that branch.

> Note: Replace `[username]` with your github username, i.e.  `profile-geraldapm.md`

add your profile in `profile-[username].md` with syntax

```md
# <username> profile
- name : xxx
- github : xxx
- email : xxx@xxx.com
- quotes : lorem ipsum sit dolor amet
```
> Note: Replace `<username>` with your github username, i.e.  `geraldapm profile`


### Add entry to Contributors.md

Now open `contributors.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

### Committing your changes

Add these changes to your next commit by running:

Run `git status` to see which changes you have made. This will look something like:

```sh
git commit -m "Your message"
```

For example:

```sh
git commit -m "added Gerald to contributors list"
```

### Push your changes to Github

Push your changes to GitHub by running:

```sh
git push origin <your-new-branch-name>
```

> Note: Replace `<your-new-branch-name>` with the name of your branch

For example:

```sh
git push origin create-profile
```
